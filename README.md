# Vehicle Calculation Program
This Python program provides three main functionalities related to vehicle performance and fuel consumption. The user can calculate travel time, fuel consumption, wheel speed in revolutions per minute (RPM), and horsepower.

## Features
- **Calculate Speed, Time, Fuel Quantity, and Fuel Cost**:
  This function calculates the travel time, fuel required, and fuel cost based on the input distance, speed, and fuel price.
- **Calculate Wheel Speed in Revolutions per Minute (RPM)**:
  This function calculates the wheel speed in revolutions per minute based on the distance covered by the wheel and the time taken.
- **Calculate Horsepower**:
  This function calculates the horsepower based on the vehicle's weight and the time taken to cover a certain distance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
- Import the math library, which is useful for future extensions of this program. Although this program currently does not require math, it can be used for more complex calculations like trigonometric functions, square roots, or logarithms.

## Usage
### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Waramate-PHET/Oil-vs-electrical
